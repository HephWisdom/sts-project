      content="Ladies in Tech is on a mission to increase the faces of women in STEM. To break stereotypes and inspire women and girls to pursue careers in STEM.To see diversity back in CS classrooms again. Our Events and stories profile diverse women, offering an authentic perspective while celebrating and acknowledging their accomplishments. Furthermore, we desire to highlight the myriad applications of computer science--from art to biology to finance--and stress the fact that an interest in computer science does not commit one to any particular industry."

                   <h4>ADMINISTRATIVE HISTORY OF THE AEROMEDICAL FIELD LABORATORY AT THE AIR FORCE MISSILE DEVELOPMENT CENTER</h4> <br>
                   
                   The Laboratory Mission and the Project Workload, Administrative Organization and 
                   Resources * GLOSSARY Since its inception a half-century ago, the United States Air Force has constantly operated higher and higher, 
                   faster and faster, until it has all but shattered the barriers of physical forces and alien physical environments which throughout
                    all history have confined the activities of man to the immediate vicinity of the earth. With every advance in velocity and altitude 
                    resulting from new types of high-performance aircraft, rockets or satellites, the potential operational environment of the Air 
                    Force has expanded until today the actual area of operations extends to the very borders of interplanetary space and the immediate 
                    potential includes the vast central portion of the solar system. And with every advance of the environmental parameters, 
                    man encounters physical and biological hazards unique in his experience. <br> <br> For many years, scientists of the Biodynamics and 
                    Space Biology Branches and more recently organized units of the Air Force Missile Development Center's Aeromedical Field Laboratory 
                    have sought to identify and understand the nature of these hazards, and to perfect protective devices and techniques for the 
                    benefit of man operating at high altitudes within the atmosphere and in the limitless space beyond. Because of the nature of 
                    its projects, the Laboratory occupies a unique position among the many other major units of the Center. It is one of the units 
                    working most directly toward man's ultimate conquest of space and was actively working toward this objective even during the years 
                    that "space work" was in official Air Force and Congressional disfavor as "impractical."
