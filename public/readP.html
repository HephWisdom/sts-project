      content="Ladies in Tech is on a mission to increase the faces of women in STEM. To break stereotypes and inspire women and girls to pursue careers in STEM.To see diversity back in CS classrooms again. Our Events and stories profile diverse women, offering an authentic perspective while celebrating and acknowledging their accomplishments. Furthermore, we desire to highlight the myriad applications of computer science--from art to biology to finance--and stress the fact that an interest in computer science does not commit one to any particular industry."

             <h1>What is Space Biology?</h1>  <br>
              The scientific study of how conditions during space flight and in the extraterrestrial environment, especially in reduced gravity, affect living organisms
             <br>
             
             <br> <h1>Space Biology Overview</h1> <br> 
           
              The main objective of Space Biology research is to build a better understanding of how spaceflight affects living systems in spacecraft such as the International Space Station (ISS), or in ground-based experiments, and to prepare for future human exploration missions far from Earth. The experiments we conduct on these platforms examine how astronauts, plants, and animals regulate and sustain their growth in space. We examine processes of metabolism, reproduction, and development. We study how organisms repair cellular damage and protect themselves from infection and disease in conditions of microgravity. And we do it across the spectrum of biological organization, from molecules to cells, from tissues and organs, and from systems to whole organisms.
            </div>

           <br>  <h1>Required Education</h1> <br>
Prospective candidates in the field will need at least a bachelor's degree for entry-level positions. There are not many educational institutions that offer astrobiology degrees, so students will want to pursue degrees in astronomy, geology, chemistry, or related fields.
         <br> 
<br> <h1>Required Skills</h1> <br>
Astrobiologists will need strong analytical skills, as they must be precise during research experiments. They should also have self-discipline and be able to work independently. Critical-thinking skills are essential, since they must be objective in examining their work and their colleagues' work to determine if it is accurate. Astrobiologists must have strong math skills and be able to perform complex operations with the data they collect during research experiments. Strong technical skills are also essential when utilizing equipment like telescopes.

<br>
<br> <h1>Career and Salary Outlook</h1> <br>
The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics does not collect employment information specific to astrobiologists; however, they report a 9% growth in employment opportunities for the category of physicists and astronomers between 2018 and 2028, which is faster than average for all occupations. The BLS reported a 2019 median annual wage of $122,220 for physicists and astronomers.
